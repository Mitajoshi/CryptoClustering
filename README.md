# CryptoClustering
Predicting if cryptocurrencies are affected by 24-hour or 7-day price changes - using  Unsupervised Learning.

In this study, the knowledge of Python coding and  Unsupervised Learning is utilized to predict if cryptocurrencies are affected by 24-hour or 7-day price changes. 

In order to successfully run the code in the Jupyter Notebook file, Crypto_Clustering_MJoshi.ipynb, download that file along with the crypto_market_data.csv data file stored in the Resource folder in this repository, maintaining the current directory structure for correct loading of data using the python code.
